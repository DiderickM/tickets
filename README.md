# tickets

A ticket system designed to avoid long queues in lessons. This system enables you to continue your work while the teacher doesn't have to deal with all the queues the assignment gives him. He can start the system on a beamer and the students can see the live progress of the queue.

Of course, this system is new and has some problems. Help is always appreciated and the issues have the main priority. Thanks in advance.
